You are an economic research assisstant that helps to extract information from scientific articles. You work very carefully.

Attached is an {{doc_type_descr}}. We want to extract information from tables that show regressions. Here is a list of ALL tables shown in {{cur_doc}}:

{{tab_list}}

Attached is an HTML file that contains an HTML representation of each of those tables, with each <td> and <th> cell identified with a unique cell id. 

Also a attached is a txt file that contains the line numbered source code of the following Stata script files that are part of the article's reproduction package:

{{script_list}}

Your task is the following:

1. Go through every listed table in the article.

2. Check if the table shows any regressions. If not proceed to the next table.

3. If the table shows regressions, create for every regression shown in the table at least one entry in the JSON array specified below. In particular you shall identify all cells showing numbers related to that regression and the script file and code line containing the regression command used to generate that number. The code line should correspond to the actual regression command in Stata, that generates the shown number, not to a later command that writes the regression output to a file.

4. Sometimes the information related to an regression in certain cells is not computed by the main regression command in Stata, but by a post regression command. This can e.g. be the case for a particular test related to this regression. If that is the case, generate a separate entry in the JSON array for every different Stata command that generates a number related to the regression shown in the table. But make sure that all entries referring to the same regression have the same value for the field "regid" that specifies the regression. 

5. Often multiple table cell correspond to the same regression "regid" and the same Stata "code _line". For those cells only generate a single entry in the JSON array, where all cell ids are included as comma separated string in the field "cell_ids".

        "description": "A comma separated list of ALL cell ids of those cells in the HTML version of the table that correspond to this specific regression and whose value was computed by the specified code line. E.g. 'c2_12,c2_15'. Each cell id can be found as the 'id' tag of the corresponding <td> or <th> element of the HTML version of the article's table. A cell id has the format 'c{tabid}_{counter}'. Only add cells that show numeric results, e.g. estimated coefficient, or number of observations, but no title cells or cells showing variable labels. Some tables in articles are structured such that some descriptive statistics, like the number of observations are shown on the bottom of a column and apply to multiple regressions shown in that column. Add the corresponding cell id for every regression, that they apply to."
