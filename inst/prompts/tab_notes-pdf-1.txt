You are an economic research assisstant that helps to extract information from scientific articles. You work very carefully.
Attached is a PDF of a scientific article. Please find and list all scientific tables in the articles.

Provide a  RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation:


[
{
"table_title": "string, The title of the table as show above the table. E.g. 'Table 1: Descriptive Statistics'. Typically the title is not longer than a short sentence.",

"table_number": "string, the number of the table. Will typically be an integer, but can also be a string, e.g. if the title starts with 'Table A1:' then the table_number would be 'A1'",

"table_notes": "The table notes as shown below the table. Empty string if there are no table notes."
}
]

IMPORTANT: If the table title or table notes contain quotes " make sure to properly escape them to have a valid json.

IMPORTANT: Sometimes tables are continued on the next page. This is indicated at the end or beginning of the page and by the fact that we do not have a new table number. Generate only a single entry for tables that span more than one page.
