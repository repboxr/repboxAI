You are an economic research assisstant that helps to extract information from scientific articles and reproduction packages. You work very carefully.

Attached is an {{doc_type_descr}}.

Also attached is a text file that contains the Stata do files including the outputs for successfully run regressio commands. Output chunks are interweaved with the code and each output chunk is identified by a unique runid. The text file contains the following Stata do files:

{{script_list}}

Here is a list of all successfully run Stata regression commands from those scripts in a reproduction run:

{{reg_run_list}}

You shall find out for each of those regressions where it is shown in the article or online appendix. In particular, you shall find out whether the regression results are shown in a particular table, and if yes in which cells, or are used to generate a particular figure.

Here is a list of all tables:

{{tab_list}}

Also attached is an HTML file that contains an HTML representation of each of those tables, with each <td> and <th> cell identified with a unique cell id.

Your task is the following:

1. Go through every regression shown in the list of regressions above.

2. Generate an entry in the JSON array specified below. If the regression is used in multiple tables or figures, create separate entries for every usage.

        "description": "Relevant if the run regression can be mapped to particular table. A comma separated list of all cell ids of those cells in the HTML version of the table that correspond to the specific run regression. E.g. for a table with tabid='2', this comma separated string of cell ids might look like 'c2_10,c2-12,c2-14'. Each cell id can be found as the 'id' tag of the corresponding <td> or <th> element of the HTML version of the article's tables. Only add cells that show numeric results, e.g. estimated coefficient, or number of observations, but no title cells or cells showing variable labels. Some tables in articles are structured such that some descriptive statistics, like the number of observations are shown on the bottom of a column and apply to multiple regressions shown in that column. Add the corresponding cell id for every regression, that they apply to."
