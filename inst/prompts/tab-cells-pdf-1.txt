Attached is a PDF of a scientific article. Please find Table {{tabid}} with the title "{{tabtitle}}" and extract its content according to the following JSON schema:

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "tabtitle": {
      "description": "Table title",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "columns": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "List of all columns shown in the main part of the table. Not every row may have a value for every column and column titles may often span more than one column. Different numbers should be in different columns.",
      "items": {
        "properties": {
          "col": {
            "description": "Number of the column. Start with 1 for the first column.",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "col_desc": {
            "description": "A short description what is shown in the column",
            "maxLength": 100,
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "type": "object"
      }
    },
    "cells": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "Add an item for every table cell. Go through the table row-by-row and column-by-column and add the cells. Every separate line in the original is a separate row. Create separate cells for separate rows, even if you think that the text content could be merged to a single cell.",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "row": {
            "description": "The row in the table. Remember every line of text or numbers in the original table is a separate row.",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "col": {
            "description": "The column of the cell. If it is a title column that spans more than one column enter the first column and set the colspan argument correspondingly.",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "colspan": {
            "description": "Will usually be 1 except for title cells that span more than one column.",
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "text": {
            "description": "The cell content as text EXACTLY as given in the original table.",
            "type": "string"
          },
          "content_type": {
            "description": "Pick a content type that best describes this cell. Often cells contain numbers in brackets like (4.31). Classify them also as number",
            "enum": ["number", "label_title", "other"],
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you add every row of the table to your cells, also initial header rows.

VERY IMPORTANT: Separate numbers into different columns. For example, we never want a cell with a content like "5.23 (3.2)" that contains both a coefficient and the standard errors. Generate extra columns even if the column header suggests that it should be just a single column.
