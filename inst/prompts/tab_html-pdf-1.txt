Attached is a PDF of a scientific article. Please find Table {{tabid}} with the title "{{tabtitle}}" and convert the table to an HTML table. Only return the HTML fragment of the table of the form

<table>
... all extracted cells ...
</table>

Don't add any further remarks. Don't bother with css styling of the table. The extracted HTML table shall neither include the table notes nor the table title.

Important: Ensure that you copy the cell content, in particular, all numbers, correctly.

Important: Try to have a column layout close to the the PDF version of the table. For example, if a column titlespans more than one column: add a corresponding colspan attribute to the td element. Separate numbers should always be in separate <td> cells. 

Important: Separate numbers into different <td> cells. For example, we never want have a <td> cell with a content like "5.23 (3.2)" that contains both a coefficient and the standard errors. 

VERY IMPORTANT: Make a separate <tr> row for each different line of text or numbers in the original table. Even if you think that multiple lines logically belong to the same cell, split them into different <tr> rows and corresponding different <td> elements if they are show in different lines in the original PDF.
